# â¬‡ Updates

1. **Review your current scripts:** Before you do anything, open your `config.lua` and `webhooks.lua` files and review any changes or customizations you may have made. Make note of these changes, as you will need to implement them in the updated script.
2. **Back up your current scripts:** Now, copy and store your `config.lua` and `webhooks.lua` files in a separate directory. This will ensure you have a backup of your original scripts that you can revert to if needed.
3. **Update the script:** Proceed to [**FiveM Keymaster**](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) and download the latest version of the script.
4. **Inspect the new files:** Open the updated script and carefully check the new versions of `config.lua` and `webhooks.lua`. Pay attention to any changes that might have been made to these files in the new version.
5. **Reapply your changes:** Apply the customizations you made (and noted in step 1) to the new `config.lua` and `webhooks.lua` files.
6. **Reconfigure if needed:** Depending on the changes in the new script, you might need to reconfigure your settings. Make sure these settings are compatible with your current environment.
7. **Check the updates channel:** Always make sure to check the updates channel for any changes related to the database. These changes might impact your script, so staying updated is crucial.
8. **Test the updated script:** Finally, before pushing your updated script live, test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

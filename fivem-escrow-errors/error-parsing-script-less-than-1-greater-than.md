# ðŸš« Error parsing script  <\1>

Example of an **Error Message**: Error detected during script parsing for @e-jobads/server/main.lua located within resource e-jobads: @e-jobads/server/main.lua:1: syntax error adjacent to '<\1>' **Potential Causes**

* Your server version might be outdated. Please ensure you are running a version no older than 4752.
* You may be transferring the folder to the VPS file by file. Please upload the entire .zip file and then extract it once it's already on your VPS. In other words, drag and drop the zip file, not the individual folders.
* You may need to clear the server caches.

**How can I confirm my server version?** To ascertain the current version of your server, input the following command into your FiveM server console: `version`.

**How can I upgrade my server version?** In order to upgrade your server version, download the latest server artifacts. Then, extract these and replace the existing files in your server folder. [Here's](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/) the official FiveM guide designed to help you update your server.

**My server version is up-to-date, but the error still exists** If the error continues to occur despite your server version being current, additional investigation is needed [here](failed-to-verify-protected-resource.md).

# ðŸ›  None of the steps work?

If I've adhered to all the steps but still encounter issues, what should I do? In case you've meticulously followed all the steps but still face difficulties, consider the following options:

* It might be necessary to wait a while (approximately 30 minutes)
* You may have misunderstood the instructions in the guide, in which case it's advisable to revisit the guide and scrutinize it more closely
* It might be required to download the script anew
* If you're certain beyond doubt that you've adhered to the guide correctly but still face issues from the escrow system, it may be necessary to reach out to FiveM support. Such errors are typically attributable to the FiveM asset escrow system rather than the scripts themselves, meaning the script developer may not be able to provide assistance for these specific issues.

**Note** These issues can be resolved. If you're unable to address them, it's highly likely due to not reading the instructions attentively. This is not an error arising from the scripts, and unfortunately, the developer is unable to assist in this regard.

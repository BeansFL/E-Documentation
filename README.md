Home Welcome to the documentation for Evolved's scripts. This resource contains detailed information on how to use the scripts effectively. Some pages may assume a basic understanding of coding principles.

How to Use the Documentation:

1. Script Structure: Most scripts will have a "config" file and a "webhook" file. The "config" file is where you can customize various settings and parameters for the script. The "webhook" file is where you can add your own webhooks to have things logged.
2. Config File: Inside the "config" file, you'll find options and variables that you can modify according to your requirements. Make sure to read the comments within the file to understand each configuration option.
3. Webhook File: The "webhook" file is where you can add your webhook integration code. Look for the designated section within the file, usually at the bottom, and insert your code there. Refer to the comments in the file for any additional instructions or guidelines.
4. Reading Comments: It is essential to carefully read the comments provided in the scripts. They offer valuable explanations and instructions above the lines of code, helping you navigate through the implementation process.

Feel free to ask any specific questions you may have while using the documentation. Happy scripting üòä!
